Exception Handling through reading numbers from a file

I created a program to:

 🔹 Read content from a file
 
 🔹 Gracefully handle situations like:
 
     . File not found
     
     . Empty file

     . Invalid (non-numeric) data

 🔹Extract valid numbers from a mixed text file
 
 🔹 Handle both positive integers and decimal numbers
 
File used: [“Read the numbers”](https://github.com/JayaraniArunachalam/Exception-Handling-in-Python/blob/main/Read%20the%20numbers)
